      description: `SIST NAV Connect is a bus tracking app for college students, offering
      real-time information on bus routes and arrival times. It uses a custom
      GPS system with ESP32, SIM800L, and NE6M hardware, sending data to a
      Django-based backend. The app also includes an admin dashboard,
      built with React.js, for managing bus routes, assigning drivers, and
      monitoring locations in real-time. This project demonstrates my skills in
      mobile app development, hardware integration, Django for backend, and
      React.js for frontend, creating a complete solution for campus
      transportation.`,
